Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires yajra/laravel-oci8 5.7.1 -> satisfiable by yajra/laravel-oci8[v5.7.1].
    - yajra/laravel-oci8 v5.7.1 requires ext-oci8 >=2.0.0 -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's oci8 extension.

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - C:\xampp\php\php.ini
You can also run `php --ini` inside terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
